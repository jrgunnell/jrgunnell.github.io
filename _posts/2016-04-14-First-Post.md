I'm putting a website together.  I don't expect to post frequently, but I hope to provide useful material.  This whole experience building a website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) takes a bit of learning up front, but I think it will be worthwhile.  Hopefully, in the not too distant future, I will have some useful scripts to share.
