<p>I'm John Gunnell, a graduate student in geomorphology at the <a href="http://marine.unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Department of Marine Sciences</a>.  I studied for my B.S. at the University of Michigan, working in Professor <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/directory/faculty/jtlehman/">John Lehman's</a> limnology laboratory.  I moved on to UNC to earn my M.S. under Dr. <a href="http://marine.unc.edu/people/faculty-2/brent-mckee/">Brent McKee</a>, using radiotracers to reconstruct sedimentation rates in an incipient salt marsh.  For my Ph.D., I continue to work under Dr. McKee, studying the transport and deposition of recent sediments.</p>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Quantifying organic carbon burial in North Carolina salt marshes</li>
	<li>Detecting fluvial sediment yield response to urbanization in the U.S. piedmont</li>
	<li>Compiling soil characteristics of natural, restored, and degraded salt marshes</li>
	<li>Relating continental-scale geomorphologic controls to coastal wetland abundance</li>
	<li>Fingerprinting fluvial sediment sources using trace metals and naturally abundant radionuclides</li>
	<li>Propagating uncertainty estimates in geochronological models</li>
