<p>I'm John Gunnell, a postdoctoral fellow at the Northeastern University Marine Science Center working under <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/justin-ries/">Dr. Justin B. Ries</a> working on various projects regarding <a href= "http://nuweb2.neu.edu/rieslab/#_ga=2.3286832.1047323263.1510849173-550805132.1473519295">marine calcifiers</a>.  The common thread across my research is the geologic processes of the Anthropocene, considering the effects of the recent past and near future of human behavior, and how they manifest themselves in the earth system.  I studied for my B.S. at the University of Michigan, working in Professor <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/directory/faculty/jtlehman/">John Lehman's</a> limnology laboratory.  Then, I moved on to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to earn my M.S. under Dr. <a href="http://marine.unc.edu/people/faculty-2/brent-mckee/">Brent McKee</a>, using radiotracers to reconstruct sedimentation rates in an incipient salt marsh.  For my Ph.D., I continued to work under Dr. McKee, studying the transport and deposition of recent sediments.</p>
